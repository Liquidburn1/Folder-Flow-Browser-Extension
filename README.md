# 📁 FolderFlow – Organize Your YouTube Playlists Like Never Before

[🌐 FolderFlow Link](https://folderflow.xyz)

FolderFlow is a browser extension that transforms the chaotic list of YouTube playlists into a clean, categorized experience. Instead of endlessly scrolling, users can now group playlists into custom folders and subfolders — all visually, right from the YouTube UI.

---

## ✨ Key Features

✅ Create folders and subfolders to group playlists  
✅ Assign icons and names  
✅ View all playlists in a responsive grid layout  
✅ Directly open, delete, or manage playlists inside YouTube  
✅ Fully local – no login, no data tracking

---

## 🎯 Why FolderFlow?

YouTube doesn't provide a native way to organize playlists beyond search and default ordering. As users build dozens or even hundreds of playlists, managing them becomes frustrating.

FolderFlow solves that — seamlessly enhancing YouTube’s interface and giving users full control, without needing to log in or sync data elsewhere.
